        - parameters for connecting to MySQL Database

    CountryCode:
        - parameters for mapping country's name and country code

    LinkedInAccount:
        - class for storing some valid LinkedIn accounts
            (currently, it contains three accounts)

        - Running with logging in a long time, those accounts might be forbidden a mount of time. To continue, It needs to add one ore valid account(s).
